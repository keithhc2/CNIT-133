<p>I am choosing to write about Twilio's SMS API, which enables developers to programmatically send SMS text messages.
Twilio's API, but users will have to sign up for a free Twilio account. 
After taking care of a few bureaucratic things such as verifying personal information and phone numbers,
 users can start using the API. Users can pick from a number of languages to use with Twilio's API, 
such as Python, Java, and even PHP. Python users, for example, will have to download and import Twilio's helper 
library into their code, and then they can use their Twilio account's account ID and authentication token 
(these two together as a combination serve as a sort-of header for authentication purposes) to start sending messages. 
With Twilio's SMS API, users can set up a messaging service, receive incoming texts, and can even include MMS (multimedia)
messages into the mix. They can even start using WhatsApp with the API!
<br><br>
The API returns a json response.
